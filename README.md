# React Portfolio

## Description 
This app was built from scratch using React so that I am able to showcase my projects. This will also serve as a place to show any future projects I have. It also has an about me section, place to view my skils, download my resume and from to complete for those who wish to contact me. This app demonstrates my knowledge of React.  I also used Vite to create this app and is deployed through Netlify.
